Description:
A path is defined by a serial of marks where each mark is with a pair of coordinates, i.e., <x, y>. A file defining the path with k marks thus looks like:
x0, y0
x1, y1
...
xk-1, yk-1
The segmentation problem wants to generate a serial of milestones along the path. The distance between milestone i and i+1 along the path is a constant. The first milestone, i.e., m0 is also the first mark in the path. It is possible that there is a tail in the path which is not sufficient for a segment. The output file contains a serial of coordinates, one for each milestone, similar to the input file. 
x0, y0
x1, y1
...
xn-1, yn-1
where n is the number of milestones.
